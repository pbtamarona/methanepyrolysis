## Hi there üëã Welcome to my GitHub!

üî¨ My research focuses on the **viability of methane pyrolysis** ‚Äî a promising route to produce low-emission *turquoise hydrogen* by thermally splitting methane into hydrogen gas and functional solid carbon. This repository supports the study titled: ***Techno-economic analysis of catalytic methane pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor with reactor-scale catalyst deactivation modeling***.

### üìÅ Repository Contents

- `run_simulation.ipynb`  
  Main Jupyter notebook to configure and run process simulation scenarios and perform the techno-economic assessment.

- `simulation.py`  
  Coordinates the entire simulation workflow, including reading input from `run_simulation.ipynb`, running Aspen Plus simulations alongside Python reactor models, and retrieving and saving the results.

- `reactor_model.py`  
  Contains the CSTR and PFR fluidized bed reactor models, involving the reaction kinetics and catalyst deactivation. These are integrated with the Aspen Plus process simulation to account for deactivation kinetics.

- `process_plant.py`  
  Retrieves simulation results and converts them into a `ProcessPlant` object, which includes calculation of capital and operating costs, as well as carbon dioxide emissions.

- `equipment.py`  
  Defines the `Equipment` class used within `ProcessPlant` to represent process equipment with attributes such as type, material, design parameters, purchase cost, and direct cost.

- `cost_correlations.py`  
  Provides a database of process equipment cost correlations and includes functions for inflation adjustment.

- `Aspen Plus/`  
  Folder containing 6 Aspen Plus simulations:
  - PFR and CSTR configurations
  - Each simulated with:  
    ‚Ä¢ Electric heating  
    ‚Ä¢ CH‚ÇÑ combustion  
    ‚Ä¢ H‚ÇÇ combustion
